\chapter{Efficient processing of raw image bitstream in CUDA}

\section{Introduction}
When working with raw camera data, the first step is generally to debayer the raw image to get a color image.
As the \cams are using a custom image format, a custom preprocessor was developed.
The preprocessor takes in the raw bytes from the cameras and bytes that can be sent directly to the \gls{h265} encoder.
To ensure high throughput and limit power consumption, the preprocessor is implemented in CUDA.
