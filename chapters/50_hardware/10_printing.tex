\subsection{3D printer}

\subsubsection{Workflow}
Having a 3D printer available changed the workflow compared to last year.
Last year everything was made at \gls{ov} as there was no real workshop available at

, so if parts were 3D printed two separate trips were requiered, one to start print and one to stop it.
Test parts were therefore not really an option.
This made using the laser cutter more favorable as multiple test parts could be made in one session.

\subsubsection{Snapmaker J1}
Idex printer makes it easier to print supports.
Bambu lab X1 and Prusa were considered.
Long delay.

\subsection{M109}

\subsubsection{Configuration}
Quite a lot of time was spent on configuring the printer.
Two different slicers were used, Cura and Luban.
Router was aquired for wireless transfer of files.
