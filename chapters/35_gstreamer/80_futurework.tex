\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Python DeepStream}
Many of the limitations of \gls{pygo} appear to be solved, or at least partly solved, by the \gls{pyds} library.
\gls{pyds} is a wrapper around the \gls{ds} \gls{sdk}, whic is NVIDIA's framework for building accelerated \gls{ai} applications \cite{nvidiaDeepStreamSDK2016}.
It builds on top of \gls{pygo} and provides additional bindings to custom \gs related functions \cite{nvidiaaiiotReleasesNVIDIAAIIOTDeepstream}.
The bindings are generated using \gls{pybind11} and the library provies an extensive tutorial on how to expand the libreary by creating custom functions and bindings \cite[\textit{bindings/BINDINGSGUIDE.md}]{nvidiaaiiotReleasesNVIDIAAIIOTDeepstream}.
