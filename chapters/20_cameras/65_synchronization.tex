\section{Synchronization (PPT+PPS)}
Fast mode \approx $50\mu s$. Accurate mode prohibits $20hz$ refresh rate.
Verified using oscilloscope and analog output.
Cameras report ptp offset, but without a proper oscilloscope it is hard to verify if this is correct.

\subsection{Reduce trigger latency}
It is possible to reduce the trigger latency of the cameras, which results in a lower synchronization offset.
This can be acheived by setting the \code{TriggerLatency} node to \code{OneLine}.
This reduces the average trigger offset down to $10\mu s$.
Unfortunately, this option becomes unavailable while the \code{TriggerOverlap} node is set to \code{set_PreviousFrame}, which is requiered for the cameras to
