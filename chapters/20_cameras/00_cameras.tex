\section{Real time image processing}
Asyncio, subprocessing, queues and a lot of pain.






\subsection*{Network card}
\subsection*{Jumbo Frames}
\subsection*{Receive Buffers}
\subsection*{Ip Address Assignment}
Local network for each eth device.
Assure no overlap.
\subsection*{Reverse Path Filtering}



\section{Compression}
H265 for video, JPEG for images.
\subsection*{gstreamer}
\subsection*{Hardware acceleration}
Verified with \gls{jtop}.

\section{Custom debayering (GPU?)}
Not needed for now, but could be useful for future work.
Currently using OpenCV debayering.

An idea is to combine debayering, I420 conversion and polarization representations into one kernel.

\section{Polarization stuff}
Save all 4 polarization channels.
Gives more options for postprocessing in cases of ie saturation.

\section{Testing and verification of the system?}
Check compression loss.

\subsubsection{Receive Buffers}

    \caption{$0^{\circ}$ polarized light is entering the pixel meant to detect $90^{\circ}$ and will be incorrectly detected as $90^{\circ}$.  This crosstalk error happens because the polarization array is placed above the micro lens \cite{lucidvisionlabsPolarizationExplainedSony2018}}
