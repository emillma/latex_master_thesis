\section{Sattelite images}
One capability that has been implemented during the development of the \gui is the ability to fetch sattelite images from the Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket) \cite{kartverketNorgeskart}.
The main intended use is to visualize where datasets are gathered.
Another potential use case that can be explored in future work is to use the sattelite images as a map during navigation.

The first challenge with this feature was to dynamically aquire a api key, needed to fetch images as this is required by the Norwegian Mapping Authority.
