\section{Managing Python Applications}
One key capability of the \srgui is to start, stop and monitor \py applications running on the \jx.
Currently one \py application is managing all the \gls{ptp} Deamons and one is running the \gls{sensorpipeline}.
Each has their own tab in the \srgui as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gui_map}.

Every time a \gls{ptp} Deamon is stopped and started the \cams use quite a long time to synchronize their time, it is thus better to keep the \gls{ptp} Deamons running separately.

In the current setup the
