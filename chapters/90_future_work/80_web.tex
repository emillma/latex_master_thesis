In a more general context a need for an efficient way to interact with programs and visualize data on remote computers was identified.
The \jx has been the current platform for the master thesis, but during future work other remote computers will be used.
A powerful workstation with a \todo was aquired last fall to be used for training and inference of \gls{ai} models during future Ph.D.
work.
The workstation is headless, that is it has no monitor, keyboard or mouse, as we are a couple of people that will be using it.
