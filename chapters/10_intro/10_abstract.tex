\chapter*{Abstract}

Data-driven models have emerged as a promising area of research in the field of \glspl{asv}.
These models have the potential to interpret sensor data and enhance situational awareness.
However, their effectiveness heavily relies on large quantities of high-quality data for training, testing, and validation purposes.

In this \master, I have completed the development of a human-operable \sr for collecting high-quality data in maritime environments.
The \sr is IP67 rated and has two polarization cameras, an \gls{imu}, and two \gls{gnss} receivers, all synchronized to UTC time.
Further sensors can be added as the sensor rig exposes two additional $1Gb/s$ Ethernet ports with PoE.

A major technical achievement has been to levrage CUDA and GStreamer for on-the-fly hardware-accelerated video compression on the Jetson Xavier, significantly extending the recording time.
In adition, ergonomic hardware enhancements have been incorporated, along with the introduction of a new web-based user interface, streamlining the data acquisition process.
Finally a small dataset was collected to demonstrate the capabilities of the sensor rig as a data collection platform.

This new low threshold approach to high quality data acquisition serves as an excellent foundation for my future Ph.D. work and have attracted interest from external parties.
Parts to create a second \sr is already ordered and there are ongoing discussions with external parties for funding a third.
This shows that the \sr has been well received and that there is a need for such a system.
