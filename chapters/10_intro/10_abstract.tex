\chapter*{Abstract}

Data-driven models have emerged as a promising area of research in the field of \glspl{asv}.
These models have the potential to interpret sensor data and enhance situational awareness.
However, their effectiveness heavily relies on large quantities of high-quality data for training, testing, and validation purposes.
Current data sets are often generated through extensive experiments utilizing full-scale systems such as MilliAmpere.
While these experiments are necessary for specific research purposes, the cost-benefit ratio may not be proportional when the primary goal is collecting sensor data.

Recognizing the challenge at hand, I embarked on the development of human operable \sr during my preproject.
The objective was to develop a lightweight \sr that addressed common challenges such as synchronization and pose estimation, paving the way for a low threshold approach to high quality data acquisition.

While most of the hardware and electronics were completed during the preproject, much remained including the challenge of developing a software stack that can effectively manage the large amount of custom raw data produced by the two polarization cameras.

As a testament to the success of this project, funding has been secured to create a duplicate \sr, and external interest has been shown towards funding a third.
