\chapter*{Preface}

This \master's thesis is part of my integrated Ph.D. program at NTNU, where I focus on enhancing multi-sensor detection for \gls{asv}.

Throughout this project, I have had the opportunity to explore diverse topics despite having limited prior experience. The process of learning new things has been enjoyable, albeit challenging at times, and it has inevitably resulted in some technical debt.

I am grateful to several individuals who have provided technical, academic, and emotional support during this journey. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Annette Stahl, for her guidance and proofreading of the final drafts. Additionally, my co-supervisors, Edmund Førland Brekke and Rudolf Mester, have offered valuable feedback throughout the semester. My colleagues at Nyhavna have been wonderful discussion partners and formidable opponents in ping pong matches.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my family for their unwavering support and their strict reminders to enjoy the sun outside the office.
Finally and most importantly, I would like to thank my soon-to-be wife, Tale Søfting, for her patience and warm hugs when I returned home from long days full of segfaults and compilation errors.
