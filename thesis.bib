The vast majority of existing hand-eye calibration techniques require a calibration rig that is used in conjunction with camera pose estimation methods. Instead, we combine structure-from-motion with known robot motions, and we show that the solution can be obtained in linear form. The latter solves for both the hand-eye parameters and the unknown scale factor inherent with structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible with such a linear formulation allows investigation of not only the well-known case of general screw motions but also of such singular motions as pure translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence, and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self-calibration process is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so forth. We conduct a large number of experiments that validate the quality of the method by comparing it with existing ones.},

  abstract = {A method called, sigma-consensus, is proposed to eliminate the need for a user-defined inlier-outlier threshold in RANSAC. Instead of estimating the noise sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales. The optimized model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus, MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation. In addition, applying sigma-consensus only once as a post-processing step to the RANSAC output always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, adding a few milliseconds.

  abstract = {Benchmark datasets that measure camera pose accuracy have driven progress in visual re-localisation research. To obtain poses for thousands of images, it is common to use a reference algorithm to generate pseudo ground truth. Popular choices include Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous-Localisation-and-Mapping (SLAM) using additional sensors like depth cameras if available. Re-localisation benchmarks thus measure how well each method replicates the results of the reference algorithm. This begs the question whether the choice of the reference algorithm favours a certain family of re-localisation methods. This paper analyzes two widely used re-localisation datasets and shows that evaluation outcomes indeed vary with the choice of the reference algorithm. We thus question common beliefs in the re-localisation literature, namely that learning-based scene coordinate regression outperforms classical feature-based methods, and that RGB-D-based methods outperform RGB-based methods. We argue that any claims on ranking re-localisation methods should take the type of the reference algorithm, and the similarity of the methods to the reference algorithm, into account.},

The system is flexible w.r.t. the amount of information available at test and at training time, catering to different applications. Input images can be RGB-D or RGB, and a 3D model of the environment can be utilized for training but is not necessary. In the minimal case, our system requires only RGB images and ground truth poses at training time, and it requires only a single RGB image at test time. The framework consists of a deep neural network and fully differentiable pose optimization. The neural network predicts so called scene coordinates, i.e. dense correspondences between the input image and 3D scene space of the environment. The pose optimization implements robust fitting of pose parameters using differentiable RANSAC (DSAC) to facilitate end-to-end training. The system, an extension of DSAC++ and referred to as DSAC*, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy an various public datasets for RGB-based re-localization, and competitive accuracy for RGB-D-based re-localization.},

In this paper we build on this group to develop a theory to associate uncertainty with extended poses represented by 5x5 matrices. Our approach is particularly suited to describe how uncertainty propagates when the extended pose represents the state of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In particular it allows revisiting the theory of IMU preintegration on manifold and reaching a further theoretic level in this field. Exact preintegration formulas that account for rotating Earth, that is, centrifugal force and Coriolis force, are derived as a byproduct, and the factors are shown to be more accurate. The approach is validated through extensive simulations and applied to sensor-fusion where a loosely-coupled fixed-lag smoother fuses IMU and LiDAR on one hour long experiments using our experimental car. It shows how handling rotating Earth may be beneficial for long-term navigation within incremental smoothing algorithms.},

This is due to the incorrect assumption, that a model with parameters computed from an outlier-free sample is consistent with all inliers. The assumption rarely holds in practice. The locally optimized ransac makes no new assumptions about the data, on the contrary \textendash{} it makes the above-mentioned assumption valid by applying local optimization to the solution estimated from the random sample.},

It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry -- represented as inverse depth in a reference frame -- and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on mostly white walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract = {Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation (VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango.},

However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a \textbackslash emph\{preintegration theory\} that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group.

Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \textbackslash emph\{structureless\} model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further accelerating the computation.

Within the technology development phase, prototype single axis gyroscopes have been realized and extensively tested for effects including temperature, acoustic and vibration sensitivities. These devices employ micro-machined all-silicon gyroscope sensor chips processed with deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). Silicon fusion bonding ensures pressures smaller than 3middot10-2 mbar. Sophisticated analog electronics and digital signal processing condition the capacitive pick-off signals and realize full closed loop operation. The current results with overall bias error smaller than 2 deg/h to 5 deg/h, scale factor error {$<$}1200 ppm, measurement range {$>$}1000 deg/s and angular random walk {$<$}0.4 radic/vh indicate that stable production of 5 deg/h gyroscopes is realistic. The fabrication technology for capacitive, pendulous accelerometer chips is based on that used for the gyros with only an increase in the enclosed pressure to obtain overcritical damping. Pulse width modulation (PWM) within a digital control loop is used to realize closed loop operation. Accelerometer chips have been tested over temperature with a residual bias error {$<$}2.0 mg and a scale factor error {$<$}1400 ppm. These sensor chips have been integrated into an IMU whereby the power budget and size of the sensor electronics have been optimized. In this paper the salient features of the gyro and accelerometer designs are presented together with an overview of the IMU system architecture. Measurement results, with a focus on environmental characteristics and robustness, are included.},

  abstract = {Accurate camera calibration is a precondition for many computer vision applications. Calibration errors, such as wrong model assumptions or imprecise parameter estimation, can deteriorate a system's overall performance, making the reliable detection and quantification of these errors critical. In this work, we introduce an evaluation scheme to capture the fundamental error sources in camera calibration: systematic errors (biases) and uncertainty (variance). The proposed bias detection method uncovers smallest systematic errors and thereby reveals imperfections of the calibration setup and provides the basis for camera model selection. A novel resampling-based uncertainty estimator enables uncertainty estimation under non-ideal conditions and thereby extends the classical covariance estimator. Furthermore, we derive a simple uncertainty metric that is independent of the camera model. In combination, the proposed methods can be used to assess the accuracy of individual calibrations, but also to benchmark new calibration algorithms, camera models, or calibration setups. We evaluate the proposed methods with simulations and real cameras.},

It is intended for storage of floating-point values in applications where higher precision is not essential, in particular image processing and neural networks. Almost all modern uses follow the IEEE 754-2008 standard, where the 16-bit base-2 format is referred to as binary16, and the exponent uses 5 bits. This can express values in the range {$\pm$}65,504, with the minimum value above 1 being 1 + 1/1024. Depending on the computer, half-precision can be over an order of magnitude faster than double precision, e.g. 550 PFLOPS for half-precision vs 37 PFLOPS for double precision on one cloud provider.},

  abstract = {JPEG ( JAY-peg) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used image compression standard in the world, and the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of 2015.The term "JPEG" is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard in 1992. JPEG was largely responsible for the proliferation of digital images and digital photos across the Internet, and later social media.JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called JPEG. The MIME media type for JPEG is image/jpeg, except in older Internet Explorer versions, which provides a MIME type of image/pjpeg when uploading JPEG images. JPEG files usually have a filename extension of .jpg or .jpeg. JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65,535\texttimes 65,535 pixels, hence up to 4 gigapixels for an aspect ratio of 1:1. In 2000, the JPEG group introduced a format intended to be a successor, JPEG 2000, but it was unable to replace the original JPEG as the dominant image standard.},

Improvements of the LO-RANSAC procedure are proposed: a use of truncated quadratic cost function, an introduction of a limit on the number of inliers used for the least squares computation and several implementation issues are addressed. The implementation is made publicly available. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel algorithm called LO + -RANSAC is (1) very stable (almost non-random in nature), (2) very precise in a broad range of con-ditions, (3) less sensitive to the choice of inlier-outlier threshold and (4) it offers a sig-nificantly better starting point for bundle adjustment than the Gold Standard method advocated in the Hartley-Zisserman book.},

  abstract = {We present SymForce, a library for fast symbolic computation, code generation, and nonlinear optimization for robotics applications like computer vision, motion planning, and controls. SymForce combines the development speed and flexibility of symbolic math with the performance of autogenerated, highly optimized code in C++ or any target runtime language. SymForce provides geometry and camera types, Lie group operations, and branchless singularity handling for creating and analyzing complex symbolic expressions in Python, built on top of SymPy. Generated functions can be integrated as factors into our tangent-space nonlinear optimizer, which is highly optimized for real-time production use. We introduce novel methods to automatically compute tangent-space Jacobians, eliminating the need for bug-prone handwritten derivatives. This workflow enables faster runtime code, faster development time, and fewer lines of handwritten code versus the state-of-the-art. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can yield order of magnitude speedups on computational tasks core to robotics. Code is available at https://github.com/symforce-org/symforce.},

  abstract = {A randomized model verification strategy for RANSAC is presented. The proposed method finds, like RANSAC, a solution that is optimal with user-controllable probability n. A provably optimal model verification strategy is designed for the situation when the contamination of data by outliers is known, i.e. the algorithm is the fastest possible (on average) of all randomized RANSAC algorithms guaranteeing 1 - n confidence in the solution. The derivation of the optimality property is based on Wald's theory of sequential decision making. The R-RANSAC with SPRT which does not require the a priori knowledge of the fraction of outliers and has results close to the optimal strategy is introduced. We show experimentally that on standard test data the method is 2 to 10 times faster than the standard RANSAC and up to 4 times faster than previously published methods.},

This optimizes a photometric cost term based on the Lucas-Kanade method. Many recent works use the brightness constancy assumption in the alignment cost formulation and therefore cannot cope with significant illumination changes. Such changes are especially likely to occur for loop closures in SLAM. Alternatives exist which attempt to match images more robustly. In our paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of real-time capable methods. We determine their accuracy and robustness in the context of odometry and of loop closures, both on real images as well as synthetic datasets with simulated lighting changes. We find that for real images, a Census-based method outperforms the others. We make our new datasets available online.},

These systems also need to be spatially and temporally co-registered to be effective. In this paper, we propose a targetless and structureless spatiotemporal camera-LiDAR calibration method. Our method combines a closed-form solution with a modified structureless bundle adjustment where the coarse-to-fine approach does not \{require\} an initial guess on the spatiotemporal parameters. Also, as 3D features (structure) are calculated from triangulation only, there is no need to have a calibration target or to match 2D features with the 3D point cloud which provides flexibility in the calibration process and sensor configuration. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method through both simulation and real data experiments using multiple sensor payload configurations mounted to hand-held, aerial and legged robot systems. Also, qualitative results are given in the form of a colorized point cloud visualization.},

When classical localization devices failed (e.g. GPS sensor in cluttered environments), aforementioned data could be used within a localization framework. This is called Visual Based Localization (VBL). Due to numerous data types that can be collected from a scene, VBL encompasses a large amount of different methods. This paper presents a survey about recent methods that localize a visual acquisition system according to a known environment. We start by categorizing VBL methods into two distinct families: indirect and direct localization systems. As the localization environment is almost always dynamic, we pay special attention to methods designed to handle appearances changes occurring in a scene. Thereafter, we highlight methods exploiting heterogeneous types of data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on promising trends that could permit to a localization system to reach high precision pose estimation within an area as large as possible.},

They have been used extensively in object reconstruction, inspection, medical application, and localization of mobile robotics. We focus on mobile robotics applications in which point clouds are to be registered. While the underlying principle of those algorithms is simple, many variations have been proposed for many different applications. In this review, we give a historical perspective of the registration problem and show that the plethora of solutions can be organized and differentiated according to a few elements. Accordingly, we present a formalization of geometric registration and cast algorithms proposed in the literature into this framework. Finally, we review a few applications of this framework in mobile robotics that cover different kinds of platforms, environments, and tasks.

  abstract = {Maritime vessels equipped with visible and infrared cameras can complement other conventional sensors for object detection. However, application of computer vision techniques in maritime domain received attention only recently. The maritime environment offers its own unique requirements and challenges. Assessment of the quality of detections is a fundamental need in computer vision. However, the conventional assessment metrics suitable for usual object detection are deficient in the maritime setting. Thus, a large body of related work in computer vision appears inapplicable to the maritime setting at the first sight. We discuss the problem of defining assessment metrics suitable for maritime computer vision. We consider new bottom edge proximity metrics as assessment metrics for maritime computer vision. These metrics indicate that existing computer vision approaches are indeed promising for maritime computer vision and can play a foundational role in the emerging field of maritime computer vision.},

  abstract = {A computational problem that arises frequently in computer vision is that of estimating the parameters of a model from data that have been contaminated by noise and outliers. More generally, any practical system that seeks to estimate quantities from noisy data measurements must have at its core some means of dealing with data contamination. The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is one of the most popular tools for robust estimation. Recent years have seen an explosion of activity in this area, leading to the development of a number of techniques that improve upon the efficiency and robustness of the basic RANSAC algorithm. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of recent research in RANSAC-based robust estimation by analyzing and comparing various approaches that have been explored over the years. We provide a common context for this analysis by introducing a new framework for robust estimation, which we call Universal RANSAC (USAC). USAC extends the simple hypothesize-and-verify structure of standard RANSAC to incorporate a number of important practical and computational considerations. In addition, we provide a general-purpose C++ software library that implements the USAC framework by leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms for the various modules. This implementation thus addresses many of the limitations of standard RANSAC within a single unified package. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm on a large collection of estimation problems. The implementation we provide can be used by researchers either as a stand-alone tool for robust estimation or as a benchmark for evaluating new techniques.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

It remains, however, a challenging task, particularly for large-scale environments and in presence of significant appearance changes. State-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but are often too resource intensive for certain real-time applications. In this paper we propose HF-Net, a hierarchical localization approach based on a monolithic CNN that simultaneously predicts local features and global descriptors for accurate 6-DoF localization. We exploit the coarse-to-fine localization paradigm: we first perform a global retrieval to obtain location hypotheses and only later match local features within those candidate places. This hierarchical approach incurs significant runtime savings and makes our system suitable for real-time operation. By leveraging learned descriptors, our method achieves remarkable localization robustness across large variations of appearance and sets a new state-of-the-art on two challenging benchmarks for large-scale localization.},

  abstract = {Visual localization is the task of accurate camera pose estimation in a known scene. It is a key problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications including self-driving cars, Structure-from-Motion, SLAM, and Mixed Reality. Traditionally, the localization problem has been tackled using 3D geometry. Recently, end-to-end approaches based on convolutional neural networks have become popular. These methods learn to directly regress the camera pose from an input image. However, they do not achieve the same level of pose accuracy as 3D structure-based methods. To understand this behavior, we develop a theoretical model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for pose regression techniques and verify our predictions through experiments. We furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related to pose approximation via image retrieval than to accurate pose estimation via 3D structure. A key result is that current approaches do not consistently outperform a handcrafted image retrieval baseline. This clearly shows that additional research is needed before pose regression algorithms are ready to compete with structure-based methods.},

Commonly used parametric camera models are limited to a few degrees of freedom and thus often do not optimally fit to complex real lens distortion. In contrast, generic camera models allow for very accurate calibration due to their flexibility. Despite this, they have seen little use in practice. In this paper, we argue that this should change. We propose a calibration pipeline for generic models that is fully automated, easy to use, and can act as a drop-in replacement for parametric calibration, with a focus on accuracy. We compare our results to parametric calibrations. Considering stereo depth estimation and camera pose estimation as examples, we show that the calibration error acts as a bias on the results. We thus argue that in contrast to current common practice, generic models should be preferred over parametric ones whenever possible. To facilitate this, we released our calibration pipeline at https://github.com/puzzlepaint/camera\_calibration, making both easy-to-use and accurate camera calibration available to everyone.},

  abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

  abstract = {Sm\aa, ubemannede luftfart\o yer (UAVer) har tiltrukket seg mye oppmerksomhet de siste \aa rene, og et av de mest studerte UAVene er quadcopteret. Et quadcopter g\aa r ogs\aa{} under kategorien VTOL-fart\o y som er et begrep som brukes om fart\o y som kan ta av og lande vertikalt. Dette gj\o r at quadcoptere har en fordel n\aa r de opererer i omr\aa der med lite plass. Sammen med deres h\o ye man\o vrerbarhet er de et godt vert\o y til \aa{} utf\o re mange oppgaver, slik som inspeksjon, transport av sm\aa{} pakker og overv\aa kning for s\o k- og redningsopperasjoner. For \aa{} \o ke flygetiden og redusere kostnadene ved \aa{} manuelt styre slike fart\o y, er det i det siste forsket mye p\aa{} autonome quadcoptre. Deler av en autonom flytur, og s\ae rlig landingen, krever et presist posisjonsestimat. Denne oppgaven unders\o ker et bruksomr\aa de hvor landingsplassen er betydelig begrenset n\aa r det kommer til st\o rrelse, nemlig \aa{} lande p\aa{} et lite, sj\o g\aa ende fart\o y. I dette tilfellet kan landingsplassen v\ae re omtrent p\aa{} samme st\o rrelse som quadcopteret selv, noe som krever et posisjonsestimat med enda h\o yere presisjon. I dette tilfellet vil ikke vanlige GPS-m\aa linger v\ae re presist nok til \aa{} utf\o re autonom landing. Derfor unders\o ker denne oppgaven bruken av kamera som hovedsensor \aa{} estimere posisjonen til et quadcopter, med forventning om at dette vil gi et bedre estimat. En landingsplattform er designet og bygget for \aa{} fungere som landingsplass i eksperimentene. Den er designet for \aa{} etterligne en standard landingsplattform som vanligvis er \aa{} finne p\aa{} sj\o g\aa ende fart\o y og marine installasjoner. Fart\o yet som til slutt vil bruke landingsplattformen er modellskipet ReVolt som er laget av DNV GL, s\aa{} designet er tilpasset for at landingsplattformen skal passe til dette spesifikke skipet.

Hovedutfordringen med et datasyn-system p\aa{} sj\o en er mangelen p\aa{} faste punkter \aa{} navigere etter, siden sj\o en er i konstant bevegelse. For \aa{} l\o se dette problemet er tradisjonelle datasyn-metoder brukt, blant annet fargesegmentering, deteksjon av kanter og deteksjon av hj\o rner, for \aa{} hente ut allerede kjente kjennetegn p\aa{} landingsplattformen. Ut fra dette er posisjonen estimert ved bruk av hullkamera-modellen og kjente m\aa l p\aa{} landingsplattformen. Metodene og algoritmene for posisjonsestimatet er utviklet ved bruk av OpenCV-biblioteket i Python, og datasyn-systemet er integrert inn i rammeverket Robot Operating System (ROS). I tillegg er en bestikkregning-modul utviklet for \aa{} gi et estimat basert p\aa{} interne m\aa linger hos quadcopteret, for bruk n\aa r ingen datasyn-estimat er tilgjengelig. Systemet er testet b\aa de i en simulator og med et fysisk quadcopter og landingsplattform, med n\o yaktige resultat i simulatoren og lovende, men st\o yfulle resultat med det fysiske quadcopteret. Til slutt er det gitt noen forslag til forbedringer av metodene og fremtidig arbeid p\aa{} temaet.},

This relationship has been modeled as \$\textbackslash mathbf\{AX\}=\textbackslash mathbf\{ZB\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mathbf\{X\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathbf\{Z\}\$ are unknown homogeneous transformation matrices. The successful execution of many robot manipulation tasks depends on determining these matrices accurately, and we are particularly interested in the use of calibration for use in vision tasks. In this work, we describe a collection of methods consisting of two cost function classes, three different parameterizations of rotation components, and separable versus simultaneous formulations. We explore the behavior of this collection of methods on real datasets and simulated datasets, and compare to seven other state-of-the-art methods. Our collection of methods return greater accuracy on many metrics as compared to the state-of-the-art. The collection of methods is extended to the problem of robot-world hand-multiple-eye calibration, and results are shown with two and three cameras mounted on the same robot.},

The recent developments in computer vision and robotics further fueled the interest on developing autonomous USVs that will overcome the aforementioned limitations, unleashing their full potential. One of the most vital and fundamental tasks in order to automate and ensure the safety of USV operations is to perform water segmentation. Despite the importance of developing such segmentation methods, there is a lack of highresolution publicly available datasets, which are suitable for training and evaluating deep learning methods. The main contribution of this paper is collecting, annotating and releasing a publicly available high-resolution dataset for developing deep learning algorithms for water segmentation in a Nordic lake environment. Furthermore, we adapt a deep learning algorithm previously applied for road segmentation to the water segmentation task. While the algorithm obtains a high accuracy, the results also allow for identifying critical limitations of the approach. Finally, we propose and evaluate a novel lightweight fully convolutional neural network architecture, fully adapted to the needs of water segmentation from highresolution images.},

  abstract = {Visual localization in large and complex indoor scenes, dominated by weakly textured rooms and repeating geometric patterns, is a challenging problem with high practical relevance for applications such as Augmented Reality and robotics. To handle the ambiguities arising in this scenario, a common strategy is, first, to generate multiple estimates for the camera pose from which a given query image was taken. The pose with the largest geometric consistency with the query image, e.g., in the form of an inlier count, is then selected in a second stage. While a significant amount of research has concentrated on the first stage, there is considerably less work on the second stage. In this paper, we thus focus on pose verification. We show that combining different modalities, namely appearance, geometry, and semantics, considerably boosts pose verification and consequently pose accuracy. We develop multiple hand-crafted as well as a trainable approach to join into the geometric-semantic verification and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art on a very challenging indoor dataset.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing photo-realistic images and videos is at the heart of computer graphics and has been the focus of decades of research. Traditionally, synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g., from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint synthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static scenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly deforming objects...},

Practical visual localization approaches need to be robust to a wide variety of viewing conditions, including day-night changes, as well as weather and seasonal variations, while providing highly accurate six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) camera pose estimates. In this paper, we extend three publicly available datasets containing images captured under a wide variety of viewing conditions, but lacking camera pose information, with ground truth pose information, making evaluation of the impact of various factors on 6DOF camera pose estimation accuracy possible. We also discuss the performance of state-of-the-art localization approaches on these datasets. Additionally, we release around half of the poses for all conditions, and keep the remaining half private as a test set, in the hopes that this will stimulate research on long-term visual localization, learned local image features, and related research areas. Our datasets are available at visuallocalization.net, where we are also hosting a benchmarking server for automatic evaluation of results on the test set. The presented state-of-the-art results are to a large degree based on submissions to our server.},

The first is a new robust estimator MLESAC which is a generalization of the RANSAC estimator. It adopts the same sampling strategy as RANSAC to generate putative solutions, but chooses the solution that maximizes the likelihood rather than just the number of inliers. The second part of the algorithm is a general purpose method for automatically parameterizing these relations, using the output of MLESAC. A difficulty with multiview image relations is that there are often nonlinear constraints between the parameters, making optimization a difficult task. The parameterization method overcomes the difficulty of nonlinear constraints and conducts a constrained optimization. The method is general and its use is illustrated for the estimation of fundamental matrices, image\textendash image homographies, and quadratic transformations. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to those of previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Scene understanding from images is a challenging problem encountered in autonomous driving. On the object level, while 2D methods have gradually evolved from computing simple bounding boxes to delivering finer grained results like instance segmentations, the 3D family is still dominated by estimating 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to jointly infer the 3D rigid-body poses and shapes of vehicles from a stereo image pair using shape priors. Unlike previous works that geometrically align shapes to point clouds from dense stereo reconstruction, our approach works directly on images by combining a photometric and a silhouette alignment term in the energy function. An adaptive sparse point selection scheme is proposed to efficiently measure the consistency with both terms. In experiments, we show superior performance of our method on 3D pose and shape estimation over the previous geometric approach and demonstrate that our method can also be applied as a refinement step and significantly boost the performances of several state-of-the-art deep learning based 3D object detectors.

  abstract = {YUV is a color model typically used as part of a color image pipeline. It encodes a color image or video taking human perception into account, allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components, compared to a "direct" RGB-representation. Historically, the terms YUV and Y{${'}$}UV were used for a specific analog encoding of color information in television systems. Today, the term YUV is commonly used in the computer industry to describe colorspaces that are encoded using YCbCr. The YUV model defines one luminance component (Y) meaning physical linear-space brightness, and two chrominance components, called U (blue projection) and V (red projection) respectively. It can be used to convert to and from the RGB model, and with different color spaces. The closely related Y{${'}$}UV model uses the luma component (Y{${'}$}) \textendash{} nonlinear perceptual brightness, with the prime symbols (') denoting gamma correction. Y{${'}$}UV is used in the PAL analogue color TV standard (excluding PAL-N). Previous black-and-white systems used only luma (Y{${'}$}) information.  Color information (U and V) was added separately via a subcarrier so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to receive and display a color picture transmission in the receiver's native black-and-white format, with no need for extra transmission bandwidth. As for etymology, Y, Y{${'}$}, U, and V are not abbreviations. The use of the letter Y for luminance can be traced back to the choice of XYZ primaries. This lends itself naturally to the usage of the same letter in luma (Y{${'}$}), which approximates a perceptually uniform correlate of luminance. Likewise, U and V were chosen to differentiate the U and V axes from those in other spaces, such as the x and y chromaticity space. See the equations below or compare the historical development of the math.},

  abstract = {Visual Localization is one of the key enabling technologies for autonomous driving and augmented reality. High quality datasets with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) reference poses are the foundation for benchmarking and improving existing methods. Traditionally, reference poses have been obtained via Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, SfM itself relies on local features which are prone to fail when images were taken under different conditions, e.g., day/ night changes. At the same time, manually annotating feature correspondences is not scalable and potentially inaccurate. In this work, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate reference poses based on feature matching between renderings of a 3D model and real images via learned features. Given an initial pose estimate, our approach iteratively refines the pose based on feature matches against a rendering of the model from the current pose estimate. We significantly improve the nighttime reference poses of the popular Aachen Day-Night dataset, showing that state-of-the-art visual localization methods perform better (up to \$47\textbackslash\%\$) than predicted by the original reference poses. We extend the dataset with new nighttime test images, provide uncertainty estimates for our new reference poses, and introduce a new evaluation criterion. We will make our reference poses and our framework publicly available upon publication.},

This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},
